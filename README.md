# Praxio

Welcome to the Praxio project! Praxio is an app aimed at helping users build and track healthy habits. The goal is to create a habit-tracking app with long-term direction that includes features such as reminders, tracking, social components, and gamification.

This app will be developed in public, and the progress of the app will be documented along the way.
