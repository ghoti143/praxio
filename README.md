# Praxio

Welcome to the Praxio project! Praxio is an app aimed at helping users build and track healthy habits. The goal is to create a habit-tracking app with long-term direction that includes features such as reminders, tracking, social components, and gamification.

This repository will be developed in public, and the progress of the app will be documented along the way. The project will be built using Firebase for backend services, with the eventual addition of a Flutter mobile app.

## Project Overview

Praxio is designed to help users:
- Track their daily habits.
- Set reminders for each habit.
- Receive notifications to help complete habits.
- Track trends over time and improve consistency.
- (Future features) Social components and gamification to encourage user interaction.

### Current Milestones:
- **MVP Ready**: The initial version of the app that allows users to log in, add habits, set reminders, mark habits as completed, and view trends.
- **Future Additions**: Integration of social features, gamification, and other advanced features to create a comprehensive habit-building tool.

## Project Structure

This monorepo contains the following directories:

- **landing/**: A simple landing page for the app, with links to the app stores (App Store and Google Play).
- **blog/**: The blog section of the website where updates, technical posts, and development progress will be shared.
- **app/**: The code for the mobile app (currently in development, not yet web-based).
- **firebase.json**: Firebase Hosting configuration file.

## Getting Started
