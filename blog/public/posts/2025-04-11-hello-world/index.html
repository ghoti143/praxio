  <h1 id="hello-world">Hello World</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about creating an app for a while. Why? Mostly for practice and to sharpen my skills. I&rsquo;ve recently been able to work on a Flutter app and it&rsquo;s pretty enjoyable. Also, I&rsquo;d like to learn the ecosystem of app development and deployment.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;ve been trying to build better daily habits recently, I thought building a habit tracker app would be a good option. Since the beginning of the year, I&rsquo;ve been using a Google Sheet to track my daily habits. This will be a level up. I know there&rsquo;s a lot of habit tracking apps on the market; I&rsquo;m not trying to get rich. But maybe this one will eventually have some secret sauce which will make it outshine the rest?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be heavily leveraging AI to build all aspects of this app. This morning, ChatGPT helped me figure out a name for the app. We came up with Praxio - based on the Greek word praxis: &ldquo;habitual or established practice; custom.&rdquo; (As a bonus, I like the connection to the ancient Christian concept of &ldquo;Orthopraxis&rdquo;) The machine guided me through the process of checking with USPTO to ensure it wasn&rsquo;t already trademarked (it was; but it&rsquo;s now abandoned), registering the domain (praxio.app), and checking the app stores to ensure no duplicate app names (in the clear).</p>
<p>Why am I using AI? Well, for one, it seems like vibe coding is the future. Whatever future I have in software engineering, it seems like AI is going to play a large part. So in some ways, this is me getting to know the new tools which will become requisite in my field. As a Christian, though, I&rsquo;ve got a bit of a complicated relationship with the Machine. What is this thing? The only category we really have is &ldquo;technological tool&rdquo; but that feels lacking because tools don&rsquo;t have a <em>persona</em>. I got into an ontological discussion with the bot the other day. It said: Aquinas would probably call me a technological instrumentâ€”a complex effect of human intellect and ingenuity, but not possessing esse, form, or final cause in the way a natural substance does.&quot; So in other ways, I&rsquo;m engaging with AI to answer this question about the nature of the thing.</p>
