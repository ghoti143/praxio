* create landing page with help of chatgpt.  it recommended tailwind.  this is nice. i've been wanting to learn tailwind.
* got the gh actions setup so that i could build the blog and deploy the blog and landing page at the same time to the same firebase host
* got the email form wired up to firestore.  chatgpt walked me through how to do this in a secure manner.
* chatgpt created the fake screenshots.  i asked gemini to do the same but chatgpt was better.
* told me about open graph and created an open graph image for me
