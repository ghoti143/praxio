Hello there, world. Praxio is under development. The initial features will basically allow the developer to replace a spreadsheet habit tracker with an easy to use app. It will allow you to add daily and weekly habits. Then when you get stuff done, you can open the app, check a box, and move on. Daily habits will be worth 1 point. Weekly habits will be worth 5 points. You can track your progress over time and see how well you are doing at performing your habits.

There's a lot of directions that Proxio can go after that. Customizations, integrations, social aspects, etc... We are developing this as an open source app, so you're welcome to join us and help shape the direction of the app.

Thanks for coming along for the ride!
