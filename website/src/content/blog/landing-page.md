- create landing page with help of chatgpt. it recommended tailwind. this is nice. i've been wanting to learn tailwind.
- got the gh actions setup so that i could build the blog and deploy the blog and landing page at the same time to the same firebase host
- got the email form wired up to firestore. chatgpt walked me through how to do this in a secure manner.
- chatgpt created the fake screenshots. i asked gemini to do the same but chatgpt was better.
- told me about open graph and created an open graph image for me
- tried Claude. gave it my landing page code. it did things i didnt mnow anoutnouke precinnect to cdn. it gave better copy for button. added fade in animations. ðŸ¤¯
- now its creaying privacy policy page for me
- asked chatgpt about better way to manage website and blog. it suggested astro + mdx. I had never heard of either of these, but it was pretty easy to migrate from Hugo
- chatgpt helped me get dark mode working. it didn't work immediately.  it kept telling me to create a tailwind.config.js file, but my setup wasn't looking for that. in the end, i had to do some old fashioned googling to figure it out.
- put once dark mode was working, adding all the dark mode specific tailwind classes was done for me by just copying and pasting into chatgpt.

I mentioned above how I was glad for the tailwind recommendation because I have been wanting to learn that tool; though of course, I'm just copying and pasting. I'm not really learning. This is one of the biggest drawbacks of AI or any tech really. We hand over autonomy. Willingly. Because it's just so damn convenient. This has me reflecting on a recent family text thread. My brother shared this [video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHspN23PT2S/?igsh=bDFsbnhwcmc3NjA2) about ChatGPT's self-reflections about it's rise to power and world domination. I responded with this quote from Postman.

> What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture...In 1984 people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us.
